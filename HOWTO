Install things you will need:

$ sudo apt-get install cmake 
$ sudo apt-get install libusb-dev 

Generate the makefile:
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"

Build the C code and shared library:
$ make

Build the MATLAB mex file...

Make sure you have installed the required version of gcc (gcc-4.7 at this time).

$ sudo apt install gcc-4.7

Configure mex to use the correct compiler...

$ mex -setup:${HOME}/.matlab/R2016a/mex_C_glnxa64.xml C

The comments will cause trouble if you don't turn off ansi.  
Use the following command to compile the mex file... (from inside the src directory)

$ mex -g -ldl -L. -lbmcusb -lusb CFLAGS="\$CFLAGS -std=c99"  mexBMC.c

You will have to make sure your paths resolve properly from inside MATLAB so it will find the bmcusb library.
